# 🛡️ CTF Writeups | Ethical Hacking

Hi there! 👋 I am a **cybersecurity student** and I created this repository as a space to publish my **writeups** of machines and labs from different platforms (HackTheBox, TryHackMe, DockerLabs, etc.).

The main goal is to share my **working methodology** when approaching an ethical hacking challenge: from the initial reconnaissance to exploitation and privilege escalation.  

I also believe that sharing these writeups can be useful for others who are learning or want to strengthen specific techniques. If anything I document here helps someone, I consider it a success. 🚀
