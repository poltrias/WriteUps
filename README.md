# Whoami👋​

I am a **Computer Engineering student** with a strong background in **System Administration**, passionate about Offensive Security.

Currently, I hold the eCPPTv3 and eJPTv2 certifications, and I use this repository to document my continuous learning journey.

The main goal is to share my **working methodology** when approaching an ethical hacking challenge: from the initial reconnaissance to exploitation and privilege escalation.

Here, I document the resolution of machines and challenges from platforms such as **HackTheBox**, **HackMyVM**, **DockerLabs**, and **Vulnyx**, treating these environments as if they were real-world security audits.

I also believe that sharing these writeups can be useful for others who are learning or want to strengthen specific techniques. If anything I document here helps someone, I consider it a success. 🚀

I am a **Computer Engineering** student, deeply passionate about **Offensive Security**. This repository serves as my technical lab, where I document my continuous learning journey and methodology.

### 🛡️ Certifications
* **eCPPTv3** (Certified Professional Penetration Tester)
* **eJPTv2** (Junior Penetration Tester)

### ⚙️ Methodology
In every challenge, I follow a professional and auditable approach, simulating real-world **penetration testing** scenarios:
1.  **Reconnaissance:** Thorough enumeration of services and potential attack vectors.
2.  **Exploitation:** Leveraging vulnerabilities to gain initial access to the system.
3.  **Privilege Escalation:** Post-exploitation techniques to achieve full administrative control.

### 🔬 Laboratories
I document machine resolutions from various platforms:
* **HackTheBox** | **HackMyVM** | **DockerLabs** | **Vulnyx** | **TheHackersLabs**

> [!TIP]
> The core goal of this space is to share knowledge. If any of these writeups help you understand a specific technique or overcome a challenge, the mission is accomplished.
