# 🛡️ CTF Writeups | Ethical Hacking

I am a **Computer Engineering student** with a strong background in **System Administration**, passionate about Offensive Security.

Currently, I hold the eCPPTv3 and eJPTv2 certifications, and I use this repository to document my continuous learning journey.

The main goal is to share my **working methodology** when approaching an ethical hacking challenge: from the initial reconnaissance to exploitation and privilege escalation. 

Here, I document the resolution of machines and challenges from platforms such as **HackTheBox**, **HackMyVM**, **DockerLabs**, and **Vulnyx**, treating these environments as if they were real-world security audits.

I also believe that sharing these writeups can be useful for others who are learning or want to strengthen specific techniques. If anything I document here helps someone, I consider it a success. 🚀
