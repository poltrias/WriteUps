I am a **Computer Engineering** student, deeply passionate about **Offensive Security**. This repository serves as my technical lab, where I document my continuous learning journey and methodology.

### 🛡️ Certifications
* **eCPPTv3** (Certified Professional Penetration Tester)
* **eJPTv2** (Junior Penetration Tester)

### ⚙️ Methodology
In every challenge, I follow a professional and auditable approach, simulating real-world **penetration testing** scenarios:
1.  **Reconnaissance:** Thorough enumeration of services and potential attack vectors.
2.  **Exploitation:** Leveraging vulnerabilities to gain initial access to the system.
3.  **Privilege Escalation:** Post-exploitation techniques to achieve full administrative control.

### 🔬 Laboratories
I document machine resolutions from various platforms:
* **HackTheBox** | **HackMyVM** | **DockerLabs** | **Vulnyx** | **TheHackersLabs**

> The core goal of this space is to share knowledge. If any of these writeups help you understand a specific technique or overcome a challenge, the mission is accomplished.
